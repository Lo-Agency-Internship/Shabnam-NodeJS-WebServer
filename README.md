# **server.js** for Node.js

Powerful server for Node.js that just works so **you can focus on your awesome project**:
Server requires **Node.js 10.19.0** or newer. **Node.js 10.x.y** LTS is recommended.

## Getting started

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Lo-Agency-Internship/Shabnam-NodeJS-WebServer.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash

You should put the contents of the cloned folder next to the files you are going to run.You can also move executable files to a cloned folder to run.
