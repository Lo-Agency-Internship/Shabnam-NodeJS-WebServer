# **server.js** for Node.js

Powerful server for Node.js that just works so **you can focus on your awesome project**:


## Getting started

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Lo-Agency-Internship/Shabnam-NodeJS-WebServer.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Shabnam-NodeJS-WebServer
```
\


\
Start the webserver by running:

```bash
  npm run start
```
\
You should put the contents of the cloned folder next to the files you are going to run.
\
And finally, put the address of your file after
http://localhost:8000/
\
for example
http://localhost:8000/file.extname
